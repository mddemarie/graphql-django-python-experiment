# GraphQL & Django experiment

I will follow the Graphene documentation and experiment with GraphQL integration into Django project.

You can find the source of my knowledge here: <http://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/> and here: <http://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/>

The more information is coming soon!

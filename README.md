# GraphQL & Django experiment

I will follow the Graphene documentation and experiment with GraphQL integration into Django project.

You can find the source of my knowledge here: <http://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/> and here: <http://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/>

Skipping the chapter about Relay.

The more information is coming soon!

## SETUP

I assume you already installed Python 3.4 or higher and pip.

### Virtual Environment

Install virtualenv via pip:

```
$ pip install virtualenv
```

Create a virtual environment for a project:

```
$ cd this-project
$ virtualenv venv
```

To use the virtual environment, you can activate it with:

```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installation

Install the project packages including Django:

```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
